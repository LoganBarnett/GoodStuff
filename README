GoodStuff extension library for C#

This library aims to provide concise and easy to use methods that solve a variety of common problems.

For example, if you want to add 10 numbers to a list, you might do the following:

for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    list.Add(i);
}

A more readable and shorter version using GoodStuff would be the following:

10.Times(i => list.Add(i));

Extensions are organized into categories by namespace so that you only need to bring in the kinds of extension methods you like for your project.  The current categories are:

- Natural language - These methods, mostly on primitive types allow for easier iteration, creation of number ranges, and utility checks such as IsNull
- Reflection - These methods encapsulate the complexities of reflection based programming to give a more dynamic language feel
